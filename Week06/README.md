# Midterm Project Overview (Due Week08):

Believe it or not, we have covered a lot of core React topics so far with our component library! When we completed our image search, we opened up the possibility of retrieving data from an outside source with the `Axios` library and API requests. Your Midterm Project is a multi week assignment where you should showcase your understanding of a few of the following topics:

- JSX and componentization.
- Passing data and functions through the Props system
- Component or App's local State using `useState()` hook
- Control over where and when a function fires in a component using `useEffect()` hook
- Retrieving data from an outside source by making an API request
- Navigating between "pages" the React way, using `React-Router-DOM`
- Installing and using external libraries via NPM
- Controlled components (input `onChange` handlers and value binding

The assignment is pretty open. Please make a single or multi page (using router) website that uses at least 3 components. Even if you do not need to re-use them on your simple project, break out different elements of the page into smaller re-usable components.

Re-use might be as simple as passing text as different Props instead of hardcoding text within. Ideally, you add in some more user interactivity, like the stars rating system we did on our recipe page (`useState()` to keep track of clicks/hearts) or using user input from a form element to change content on the screen. While building your project please keep the following in mind:

- concept|theme of the site (not just random images and links that show skill)
  an existing website you drew inspiration from (bonus points for Pinterest
  collection or mood board)
- concepts|skills we have covered that you will use to build your site
- concepts|skills you need to still learn to complete the project

## In Class Presentations

You will be presenting **Tuesday Week08**. Please be sure to document your project with either a slideshow or a markdown file inside your class repo. Be sure to include:

- A demo of the site and the progress you have made
- A snippet of code you figured out (perhaps a tutorial you found or some other feature you figured out)
- Next steps (if you had more time, or if you plan on continuing to add functionality for your final)
- Your midterm project code and documentation (and copy of slideshow - link to google slides or pdf of your presentation slides) must be present in your repo.
- Presentation is part of your midterm grade, this is how it is marked on-time. I will not be grading your code until the Friday after you present. If you make any considerable changes within the extra time, please email me so that I am aware your project may look/behave differently than when you presented.
