# HW Due Tuesday Week06:

Today's class will cover React Router and navigating between pages. We will also build a NavBar component that hooks into to React Router using Links.

By now you should have made your own reusable UI component and styled it using TailwindCSS. Make sure you have a Page for it. This has been loosely assigned for the past 2 weeks. If you have not completed your own Component and Page, make sure you finish that assignment first before moving on.

This weeks HW, due Tuesday of Week06 is to add a Route for your new page, and add it to the NavBar component we created in class.

## PSA: We are 1/3 through the semester!

### Time to start thinking about yout Midterm!

**Your Midterm project will be Due Tuesday Week08. The midterm project is as follows:**

Build a webpage in React. The goal is to break the page into as many atomic Components as possible with a goal of reusabilty. How do we make Component reusable/customizable? _PROPS!_

Now that we are wrapping up our Components Library lessons, we will be learning other goodies like the proper way to wire up and implement forms, how to connect to an outside API, and eventually central data/logic control Context and data persistence with a database. Feel free to sprinkle in any of these topics into your project, the sky is the limit! I will provide you with the bare minimum (MVP) checklist next week.

Your Midterm will be graded in 2 Parts.

- In order for your Midterm to be considered ON TIME, you **must** present you project in Class Week08. A simple slide deck + a live demo is the easiest way to do this. For now, focus on building the webpage part first.

- Next week I will give you a list of what you should include in your in class presentation.

- You must also submit the code for your Midterm Project. Think of it like a multi week HW Assignment. Add a folder to your personal class repo just like you have for your HWs but title it MIDTERM. Be sure it included all of your files but `.gitigore` the `node_modules/` folder. We never commit that folder to our repo because it is HUGE and as long as we have the correct `package.json`, anyone who pulls your code (like your teacher) simply has to run an `npm install` command to get your project up and running on thier own computer.

- Documentation: When you create a new React project, it generates a `README` file with instructions on how to get the app up and running. A good frist step is editing that to describe your app, what it does, and how to get it set up. What external libraries are installed? If someone did clone you project and wanted to use it and build upon it, how would they do that?
  Since this is also a class project, be sure to add in the information/documentation from your slide presentation as well. (Again, I will provide you with a list of points to hit in your presentation next week. For now, just worry about getting it built!)
