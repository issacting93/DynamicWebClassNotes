### Announcement: Thursdays class will be held via Zoom.

Please keep your eyes peeled for an email to schedule Thursdays Zoom class with a link to the meeting. The LIRR is threatening to strike this Thursday, which would lead to a complete shutdown of the LIRR. This will affect both students and teachers ability to commute to class (including your teacher). As a result, we will meet on Zoom on Thursday 9/18 at 8:00am.

## HW Due Tuesday Week04

Make your own reusable component in the `components/` folder and a page that demos usage in the `pages/` folder. If you are having a hard time coming up with ideas take a look at Bootstrap or some other framework for ideas.

Next week we will be creating a `menu` component that utilizes React Router's routes and `<Link>` component so that we can navigate across each of our component demo pages. Take a look at the React Router docs, or if you prefer videos [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIUuqZaq_8s) gives a really quick usage of the `Link` component from `ReactRouterDOM`. If you're feeling ambitious, give it a try in your own project! This will be the topic of next Tuesday's class.
