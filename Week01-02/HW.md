[Read Through This Git Tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

- Make sure you have all software set up for next class.

- Practice creating a new react project, editing the starter files, and creating components using JSX and loading content from data. This part of the HW will make more sense after we complete Thursdays class.

Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class today.

### In Class Continued

Current Project:
- Hide/Show [+] and [-] buttons based on current count. For example if we have 5 stars, hide the [+] button since we cannot add any more
- Update the styling so that the hearts and button locations do not jump as things hide/show
- Add a header and wrapper element to the page to make it look more like an app or webpage

Other:
- Make sure you are up to date with your assignments and understand class notes and exercises up until this point before next week. Next week we will play a little more with State before diving in to Redux!
